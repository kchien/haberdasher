## Version 0.0.2

Fixes error on my part where I did not include the necessary classes in `haberdasher.rb` so
that the gem would work out of the box.

## Version 0.0.1

Relies on activesupport 2.3.5.  Future versions will relax this requirement;
most likely, it will be listed as "~> 2.3.5" (twiddle waka) instead of "2.3.5"
